        <p>A mega tectonic event that had diligently and surreptitiously simmered for millennia,
          propelled an itinerant landmass (Indian plate) towards present day’s Asia on a sluggish
          time scale. In due course, this drifting gargantuan earth plate fueled by a monomania to
          explore the possibility of unique creation, collided eventually with unimaginable force
          some 50 million years ago, leading to the manufacturing and rise of the world’s highest
          and youngest mountain range “The Himalaya”. The fact that Himalaya continues to rise
          till date by few millimeters every calendar year, alludes that this particular sphere of
          earth is explorer in nature with tremendous active fire in its belly for new possibilities.

          Network of thundering rivers, cornucopia of hydrothermal springs, calm-sessile jade blue
          lakes and moisture loaded clouds those are tossed around the fluted spires of the king of
          the mountain, are the byproduct of tremendous toil that the Himalaya had been up to for
          Aeon. Indian plate further panned shallow Tethys Sea, throwing it up to form Tibetan
          Plateau, a sere, desiccated and surprisingly interesting landform for explorers to tread
          upon and wonder in awe.

          The seismic spasm Himalaya experiences, reminds us its dynamism. Its dynamic nature
          can also be experienced in the form of rollicking rivers hurrying to meet seas, strong
          wind that riffles a musical rendition in the foliage of Himalayan Forest, Towering spires
          those are jutting beyond clouds, all inspire us to set the goals high. Himalaya is also a
          treasure trove of the nature`s marvel it has in store. From cradling world’s greatest
          stockpile of ice outside polar region to the word`s ten highest peaks
        </p><br />

          Himalaya checks and squeezes the itinerant moisture laden cloud with its towering
          height to let Tibetan plateau remain a dry wonderland. At the same time forces the
          billowing cloud to shower their bounty on a landscape to its south all the way to Sri
          Lanka and beyond. Thus, imparting it with a dash of green for many months. It probably
          functions in such a manner to impart explorer an assorted menu of travel possibilities to
          choose from and satiate their thirst with its diverse things of scheme.
